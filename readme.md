1.Background and Motivation(motivation, background, or problem definition)

Multiple  objective  solution  methods  vary  according  to  the 
characteristics  of  the  problem  formulation  (e.g.,  linear  or non - linear  and  size) 
useful classification  of  methods  according  to  the  timing  of  the information  provided below.  


1. priori  before  solution 
2. progressively  during  solution
3. posteriori  after  solution. 

according  to  the  quantity  of information  provided, 
A  different  approach  is  taken
The  solution  methods  in  this  category  first  elicit subjective  information  
from  the  client  which  is  then  utilized  to find  a  preferred  solution. 


Specifically, the  client  assigns  a  goal  or  target  to  each  objective  and  then 
seeks  to  minimize  the  deviations  from  each  goal.  

These deviations,  which  represent  both  over  and  under  achievement of  goals,  
are  then  weighted  the  DM  so  as  to  reflect  their relative  importance. 

The  deviational  weights  and  can  be  either pre-emptive,  
in  which  case  goals  of  higher  priority  must  be fully  satisfied  
before  lower  priority  goals  are  considered: or  additive,  
whereby  all  goals  are  at  the  same  priority  level and  considered  simultaneously.  
Combinations  of  these  two cases  are  also  possible,  

e.g.,  using  additive  weights  among three  objectives  which  all  have  the  same  priority.  
The informational  burden  placed  on  our side  is  to  specify  two  types of  information  
for  each  objective  before  solution. 

pre-emptive  weights  imply  that  since  one  objective  
must  be  fully  satisfied  before  a  second  objective  is even  considered,  the  is  infinite.  
No  amount  of inducement  will  convince  the  client  to  sacrifice  some  of  objective  

This  can  be  multiplied  through  and  deviational  variables added  to  give where  minimization  of  the  deviations  will  seek  to  achieve  the desired  liquidity  ratio.  



here we have a simple problem to solve.

we need to decide which one of the 3 plan to take. hence, we use 5 characteristics to evaluate each plan's score.

A -> 2+4+3+5+3
B -> 4+3+4+5+4
C -> 5+2+5+5+4



2. Methodology
-Weighting Method


-Compromise Programming
Minimize the distance from solution to ideal point 
That is, we solve the optimization model with single-objective
function first!

- Sequential (Priority) Method/ Preemptive Optimization
Disadvantage: If solving previous objective gives unique
solution, to solve follow-up objectives is meaningless.

pre-emptive  weights  imply  that  since  one  objective  f. 
must  be  fully  satisfied  before  a  second  objective  is even  considered,  the  is  infinite.  No  amount  of inducement  will  convince  the  OM  to  sacrifice  some  of  f.  

This  can  be  multiplied  through  and  deviational  variables added  to  give where  minimization  of  the  deviations  will  seek  to  achieve  the desired  liquidity  ratio.

4. Comments

client's opinion is the major pricinple which we should comfirm first
however
