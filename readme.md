### 1.Background and Motivation

In real life, everyone may face many choices to choose, but trying to optimize multiple functions. 

therefore, according to the problem function, there are many multiple objective solution methods.

Here below are useful classifications, according to the timing of the information provided.  

-1.Prior Articulation of Preferences (before solution)

-2.Progressive Articulation of Preferences (during solution)

-3.Posterior Articulation of Preferences (after solution)

-4.No Preference Information

A different timing  of information  provided, A different approach Preferences  is  taken.



### 2. Methodology For Prior Articulation of Preferences

The client sets goals or targets to each objective for seeking to minimize the loss from each goal.

Specifically, the solution methods first elicit subjective information  from the client which is then utilized to find a preferred solution.

- Weighting Method
These objectives, which represent both over and under achievement of goals, reflect the relative importance of the weighted of the client. 

- Compromise Programming
Optimize these single-objective, and then shrink the range by solving these different single-objective.

- Sequential Method
Solve the first objective function and then the second one. But if only unique solution from the previous objective, it is meaningless for follow-up.


### 3. Example

see the ipynb.

### 4. Comments

Clients opinion is the major principle which we should confirm first.
However, it's not really that the clients understand what they need clearly.
The hardest point and also the core point is how to help our clients to define the main target(s) and the second target, and others.
Hence, more possibly, we may not have the good prior articulation.
